# About Me üé∏ üßë‚Äçüíª
My name is Yuval Argoetti, and I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic biomedical engineer. I am a self-learner and a team player who believes in hard work, persistence, and continuous learning to evolve and expand my knowledge while developing new skills.

## Education
### B.C.e Biomedical Engineering at Tel Aviv University (October 2019 to August 2023). 
During my education, I specialized in Machine & Deep Learning, Signal & Image Processing, and Robotics. I have gained valuable theoretical knowledge and practical skills in these areas, which have contributed to my proficiency in various technical domains.

## Field of Interests
I have a keen interest in the following fields:

* Deep Learning
* Machine Learning
* Computer Vision
* Signal Processing
* Robotics

## Technical Background
I possess strong technical skills in the following areas:

* Python
* PyTorch
* OpenCV
* MATLAB
* Deep Learning
* Machine Learning
* Signal Processing
* Image & Video Processing
* System Integration
* Engineering Design
* Risk Management

In addition to my formal education, I have self-taught myself Solidworks, C++, and Arduino, further expanding my technical skill set.

## Main Projects
### Deep & Machine Learning Projects
During my academic journey, I have undertaken several deep learning and machine learning projects, including:

- Created and trained PyTorch neural network models, such as Transformer for NLP and CNN for image classification. These projects showcase my expertise in deep learning and hands-on implementation.
- Developed continuous monitoring systems involving data collection, sampling, filtering, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. Notable projects in this domain include hand gesture prediction using gyroscope and accelerometer data from a wearable device and an activity prediction system utilizing data from multiple sensors of smartphones.

### Audible-Feedback Accessibility Device for Visually Impaired
I have designed and developed a device that converts visual feedback to auditory feedback for home appliances, enabling visually impaired individuals to receive real-time program updates. This project involved the use of Arduino and demonstrated my ability to apply technical knowledge in developing innovative solutions.
